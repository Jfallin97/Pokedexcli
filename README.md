# Pokedexcli
A project I did for a website called Boot.Dev. Still needs a few features. Uses PokeAPI.
I am happy with it, however, I am not happy with my STRUCT names lol. As well as a few spaghetti code.
As I worked through the JSON of PokeAPI, I had to constantly add one more layer via a new STRUCT.

Features to be added:
---------------------
- Party system
- Create a seperate function for API calls

Features I want to add:
-----------------------
- Shiny Pokemon



Thise project used Clause in order to help break down functions step by step. Code was not copied, however, the idea of some functions were walked through without code. (CORRECTION: I did use code from the assignment itself. Specifically, the testing portion.)
